# MordhauStatCollector
Program to connect Mordhau mods to Skalagrad site

Theoretically, should be run server-side to interface with Custom Skirmish Mod.
Realistically, its just to see how that can be done.

Not finished, but stuff like exporting stats to site via reading a Savegame file and sending its data as JSON via http was tested and it works.
